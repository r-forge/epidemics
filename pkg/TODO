## legend:

== DYNAMICS ==

o include density-dependence



== TIME EXPLICIT SAMPLING ==

x keep track of dates of 'activity' of the pathogens

- sampling isolates with constrained date




== PARAMETER ESTIMATION ==

- random generation of parameter values

- MCMC estimation

- write MCMC outputs to file

- compare different summary statistics




== HANDLING I/O ==

- write simulation outputs to file

- read simulation parameters from file

- make R interface

- get R package to compile
