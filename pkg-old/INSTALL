On linux platforms, GNU Scientific Library (including headers) is needed.
- give links to website
- give name apt of packages on different distro
- give example on how to find the package and install it

To compile/install from the sources.
Tested on windows XP 32 bits (virtual machine):
1) Install Rtools:
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/

2) install GSL for windows:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm
selecting "Complete package, except sources"

3) create an environment variable called LIB_GSL and define it as the path to GnuWin32. By default, it is:
"C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\"
(don't forget the quotes)

4) copy the files "\GnuWin32\bin\libgsl.dll" and "\GnuWin32\bin\libgslcblas.dll" to "\GnuWin32\lib\".

5) then, R CMD build/INSTALL should work nicely
